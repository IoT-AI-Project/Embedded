THIS IS A PROJECT THAT MAKES A RASPBERRY PI 3 WORK AS AN ACCESS POINT AND WHEN A DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO ITS IP ADDRESS,
IT DIRECTS THE DEVICE TO THE HARDWARE CAMERA MODULE OF THE PI. IN THAT WAY EVERY DEVICE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE RPI'S NETWORK, SHOULD HAVE 
A FULLY OPERATIONAL LIVE STREAM OF WHAT THE HARDWARE CAMERA IS FILMING IN THE POSITION THAT IS INSTALLED.
