THIS IS A PROJECT THAT MAKES A RASPBERRY PI 3 WORK AS AN ACCESS POINT AND WHEN A DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO ITS IP,
IT DIRECTS THE DEVICE TO THE HARDWARE CAMERA MODULE OFT THE PI. IN THAT WAY EVERY DEVICE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE RPI'S NETWORK, MAY HAVE 
A FULLY OPERATIONAL LIVE STREAM OF WHAT THE HARDWARE CAMERA IS FILMING IN THE POSITION THAT IS INSTALLED.
